The files that contain the implementation are
 - ARIMA.ipynb
 - SARIMA.ipynb
 - Exp_Smoothing.ipynb

Each file should be opened and run in Jupyter Notebook or another notebook environment with at least Python 3.8 installed. 
The implementation might work with lower version of Python but untested

Needed Python libraries
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - statsmodels
 - scipy

Functions that you can run in each file
ARIMA.ipynb
 - myARIMA(data, p, d, q)
   you can modify the p and q parameters as you want. d = 0 or d = 1 are the only values that work

SARIMA.ipynb
 - Just copy paste the structure of the code block and change the parameters as desired

Exp_Smoothing.ipynb
 - SES(data, h)
   h = number of future timesteps to forecast

 - holt_linear(data, phi, h)
   optional value for 0 <= phi <= 1. default is 1

 - holt_winters(milk, mode, m, h)
   mode is either "add" or "mult"
   m should be 12 for the milk dataset
